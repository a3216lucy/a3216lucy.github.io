## Bio

I was graduated from [The Tamkang University（TKU）](https://www.tku.edu.tw/), major in Information Management, was a visiting scholar at the [University Of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) - [Blockchain X-Lab](https://scet.berkeley.edu/blockchain-lab/) and now at the [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/)'s HCI Lab.

I discovered my passion for Blockchain and Distributed Consensus at the age of 19, quitted my position as a Data and AI Associate Consultant at Microsoft, and co-founded my company [Turing Chain](https://turingchain.tech/) and [TuringCerts](https://certs.turingchain.tech/). However, in late 2019, due to the interests within the founding team that could not align, I left my companies and resumed study, yet the start of the political protests in Hong Kong led me to return to my home country Taiwan. I am thus now a visiting student at NTU and has been a researcher in the HCI Lab under [professor Cheng](http://www.lungpancheng.tw/) since early 2020. Driven by my growing interest in VR, I started my YouTube Channel [_VRemix_x_](https://www.youtube.com/VRemix_x%E8%B3%87%E5%B7%A5%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E6%9D%8E%E5%A9%B7%E5%A9%B7) in September 2020 and gained 6K subscribers and 11K monthly views within 1.5 months. In my free time, I write technical tutorials on my Medium blog with 4.6K subscribers worldwide to date.
